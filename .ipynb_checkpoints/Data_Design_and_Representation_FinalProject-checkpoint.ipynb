    "Jones Dozers is a construction equipment company which needs to keep track of the manufactured equipment and respective transactions so as to leverage the data in a systematic way to support their business strategies. As consultants to Jones Dozers, our aim is to help the company build a relational database (as relational database systems work best for any business transaction data storage and processing) and our first step is to gather requirements from stakeholders and build a conceptual model. This database will store the information on the equipment it makes, rentals and sales of the equipment, customers who rent or buy the equipment and the sales reps who conduct the rent or sale transactions.

    "We resorted to Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling for conceptualizing the database model using the online platform, ERDplus.com. The first step was to identify each entity to track, their attributes (unique and others) and relationship (along with type of relationship) between entities (including self). Once the ER diagram was built, the next step was to create a relational schema to identify the structure of each table to be included in the actual database. Once the model is finalized, the final step is to identify the choice of the database system (MySQL, BigQuery, SQLServer, etc.) and use SQL codes to insert, update or query the database. Such data models also serve as building blocks in creating analytical databases to analyze the sales, revenue and inventory data to produce business insights and help them make more data-driven decisions. A dimensional model for a data warehouse can be easily created using this database."

    "\n",
    "Current version: 3.6.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweepy is an open-sourced library which can be used with python to communicate with Twitter platform and its various API. With tweepy, it is possible to get any object and use any method that the official Twitter API offers, for instance, user, status etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the project, we will use Tweepy’s StreamingAPI to capture real-time tweets based on some tags (filters) in an asynchronous call and save the data to a relational database using sqlite3 library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   ** Authentication Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **STEP 1**: Create an app at https://apps.twitter.com/app/new. Refer https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started#get-started-app for more documentation\n",

    "* **Fascinating features**\n",
    "\n",
    "Twitter streaming API is used to download tweets in real time. It is useful for obtaining a high volume of tweets, or for creating a live feed using a site stream or user stream. It is significantly different from REST api because the REST api is used to pull data from twitter but the streaming api pushes messages to a persistent session. This allows the streaming api to download more data in real time than could be done using the REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in this project, the way we have used the StreamingAPI is by calling it asynchronously, which increases the performance of this program significantly. If done otherwise, the main thread will have to wait for the streaming execution to complete and the way this has been designed is that it does not disconnect automatically. This means an external interruption is needed for disconnection like a KeyBoard interrupt, hence delaying the steps thereafter. Moreover, asynchronous implementation allows for parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Model and JSON Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We studied the Twitter JSON response object and structure here - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/intro-to-tweet-json.html. Following is the fundamental structure of a Twitter object.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Foundational Work**\n",
    "\n",
    "We began with understanding the Twitter API in depth by reading through its documentation followed by Tweepy. We created a developer application named 'analyzing_tweets_123' and secured the requisite access tokens to connect with the API. We then understood the response json and data model of Twitter going through the object details and attributes, especially the different services and features available to query this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our understanding of the response JSON, we designed a data model with two entities - 'user' and 'tweet' We used ERDPlus tool to create the relational schema with each table containing select fields from the response json.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "We used sqlite3 package to create a SQL database and the two tables. We then created classes for each entity and encapsulated functions with SQL queries to insert the data for class attributes to the database. On the API end, we used StreamListener service by Tweepy to receive real time streaming tweets on two tracks ('Avengers' and 'Deadpool2'). This API call was made asynchronously. Once we received sufficient data, we closed all the connections and re-established a database connection from outside of the class to query the two tables to test the pipeline"

    "## Key learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is an enormous potential for analysis and a plethora of use cases based on Twitter's data especially as we learned from the different objects and attributes in the response json\n",
    "* Ingesting the Twitter data in a relational database has many advantages such as structured schema, simplicity of design, vertical scalability though they are slower than NoSQL databases\n",
    "* Even though in this project we pushed the data in a relational database, we could have also used a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or an in memory database such as Redis depending upon the use case\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tweepy gives a feature to make asynchronous call to the Twitter API and I believe it is a great feature to have especially when streaming high velocity and high volume real time tweets and doing real time analytics on them. It is especially useful to ensure the streaming response works parallely while the main thread continues with the processing of consequent code\n",
    "* Decoupling the code improves the efficiency. For instance, in our code above, even though we created the database connection inside the MyListener class object, we closed it once the data was received and inserted in the database. For querying the data we created another connection outside of the class. This is what happens in the industry as every team / application / task needs to be separate from the other. REST SOAP services architecture is one example for instance. Microservices are more widely used now\n",
    "* Object oriented coding by making classes and using its object instances is an effective approach for problems such as these especially when upscaling and productionizing of the code is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**API**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Working with Opensource APIs is became a lot more fun when we encountered a bug in the response json sent by Twitter. Basically, if the retweeted variable is set to False, ideally we should be able to filter out the retweeted logs. However, the response json for retweeted data\n",
    "* Working with twitter API is another world as there are various services and the applications are humungous for instance sentiment analysis, customer profiling, targeted advertising, designing digital marketing campaigns etc."

    "# movie reviews of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) in IMDB\n",
    "reviews = [\"\"\"This film was to put it simply rubbish. The child actors couldn't act, as can be seen by Harry's supposed surprise on learning he's a wizard. \"I'm a wizard!\" is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering \"how are they doing that?\" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers. Bring on the next one!\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"This film is simply awful, the acting is a joke. Being a fan of the book I decided to buy the DVD without seeing at the cinema or renting it before, but I was extremely dissapointed. Daniel Radcliff's acting is terrible, in my honest opinion he was only hired because he looks like the illustrations of Harry Potter and he is definatly what I had pictured in my mind but his acting makes a mockery out of the film and turns it into a spoof of the book, instead of bringing it to life. I definatly won't be rushing to the shops to get the second film too soon.\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"It's a movie made for people who think that magic is cute and fun. If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did. Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad. Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go. There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot. In all this, the film is an excellent adaptation of the book, which also thought that magic is cutesy wootesy.\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"2 1/2 hours of Boredom. Half the audience fell asleep, including most of the kiddies. Beautiful to look at, but that does not make for a interesting film. Rather spend your money on Lord of the Rings.\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"Ya~ When my first grade elementary school, my mom took me to watch the Harry Potter movie. Harry Potter series of movies really accompanied I grow up.\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"I really love this movie. There is something very magical about it, and gives me such nostalgic feelings seeing it as a child (and reading the books too) and I really think they succeeded with the movie adaption from the book.\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"That's all there is to say. It'll never be as good as the books, but it came damn close. They picked three great kids for the leads, and did a good job with the other roles as well. As far as how the story translated to the big screen, well, obviously, some parts recived more or less attention than in the book, and the same applies to characters. But overall, it was great!\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was an excellent film, in a series of Harry Potter films. Although not as good as Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets it was very high up in its ratings. The acting in this movie was wonderful. It had great special effects and dialog.I personally felt it was amazing that the whole movie was done by kids who have just started acting, but was still an amazing movie. Emma Watson was perfect in her acting as Hermione.Good Job.\"\"\",\n",
    "          \"\"\"This movie was so corny and unimaginative, a real Chris Colombus piece of hack work. The great cast saves the film from being utter dreck, but otherwise this is pretty dim, formulaic movie-making. Compare it to its announced competition, movies like The Wizard of Oz, Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Never Ending Story, or even more recent fare like The Secret Garden or Photographing Fairies. C'mon, you've got to admit this flick is mediocre at best. Stop lapping up the hype and buying into every stupid trend they throw at you. Discriminate a little.\"\"\"]\n",

    "## Summary of the solution and key highlights:\n",
    "* First, we use glob to import all text data and load in the sequence of train negative, train positive, test negative and test positive. Doing this can help us to devide the dataset to train and test, negative and positive in later session.\n",
    "* Clean the row log files by adopting English lemmatization, punctuation removal and English words removal. The NLP tools that we used in this project is from the python package nltk.\n",
    "* Punctuation removal: Remove punctuation in text and sentences such as apostrophe, brackets, colon, comma and etc.\n",
    "* English lemmatization: remove inflectional endings only and to return the base or dictionary form of a word.\n",
    "* Stopword removal: remove all stopword words in the text such as \"the\", \"for\", \"a\" and etc.\n",
    "* Performed Bag of Words (BoW) to collect the document-term frequency table.\n",
    "* Performed Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and tried both unigram and bigram methods.\n",
    "* Performed Feature hashing to reduce the number of features (reducing to 50 features as an example).\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis - Training and testing a Naive Bayes classifier using BoW text representation(acc. socre = 0.819).\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis - Training and testing a Naive Bayes classifier using UNIGRAM TF-IDF text representation(acc. socre = 0.827).\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis - Training and testing a Naive Bayes classifier using Feature Hashing text representation(acc. socre = 0.589).\n",
    "* End up with choosing the Naive Bayes classifier using UNIGRAM TF-IDF text representation. And tested this winning classifier on some IMDB movie reviews.\n",
    "* The trained classifier achieves 90% accuracy on real IMDB data!\n",
    "* Explored Sentiment Analysis using AWS API."

    "## Key learnings:\n",
    "* Whenever we are dealing with Machine learning algorithm the most important part we have to keep in mind is to pre-process data before feeding to machine learning. The accuracy of predictions depends directly on the training data set which further depends on the data preprocessing and data wrangling.\n",
    "* Punctuation removal, Lemmatization and Stopword removal are some key steps to preprocess the text data. It can reduce the noice in a very large extent.\n",
    "* TF-IDF is a method to select the words that are frequently appear in certain document but not frequently appear in the overall corpus. This method is powerful when problem meet this condition but sometimes the problem may have differnt characteristics.\n",
    "* Feature hashing is a simple but powerful method to reduce data dimension but how to choose the number of features is an important but tricky problem.\n",
    "* N-gram generally performes better than unigram, however, n-gram will cause a significant increase of the computational resource.\n",
    "* APIs are very powerful in many cases, we should take utilization of it!\n",
